To run the notebooks contained in this repostiory, first download the dataset from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jlz8MWKVHd7CWkA9Li_7wqkn5qM2JDSS/view?usp=sharing) (*LAsignals.csv*) and [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gABFWE-Bd7a34E3sdSQKCeoRjgoIyt6t/view?usp=sharing) (*aligned_LAsignals.csv*) and place them in the same folder as this README. 

*aligned_LAsignals.csv* has been created using the script [`alignment.py`](alignment.py).

**Remark:** whenever a confusion matrix is plotted, the threshold for clustering a signal as anomaly needs to be specifically tuned according to the anomaly frequency plot.
